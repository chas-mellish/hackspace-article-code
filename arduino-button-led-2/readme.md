# Arduino Pushbutton LED (#1)

This is the Arduino Blink application modified to turn the LED on/off based on the status of a pushbutton connected to the Arduino. This version of the project implements [debouncing](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/debouncing) to delay toggling the LED to give the pushbutton connection time to settle.
